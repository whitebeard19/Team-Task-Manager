## Project Overview

A simplified project management tool inspired by Jira. Users can create projects, manage tasks, invite team members, and track progress with role-based permissions.

---

## Functional Requirements

- User registration, login, and profile management.
- Create and administer projects.
- Project membership invitations with roles (`admin`, `member`).
- Create, assign, and manage tasks with status and priority.
- Members can update task progress; admins oversee projects.

---

## System Architecture

- **Backend:** Spring Boot 
- **Database:** MySQL 
- **Frontend:** 
- **Authentication:** JWT/OAuth2 
- **Hosting:**

## Database Design

### Entities Summary

| Entity          | Description                             |

| User            | Registered system users                 |
| Project         | Projects created/owned by admins        |
| ProjectMembership| User membership and roles in projects   |
| Task            | Tasks with assignment, status, priority |

### Detailed Schema

## Entity Relationship Diagram

*Insert or link your ER diagram here.*

---

## Implementation Details

- Entities use JPA annotations with foreign key mappings.
- Enums used for roles, task status, and priority.
- Timestamp fields automatically managed.
- Service layers enforce business logic and security.
- Controllers expose REST APIs.

---

## API Documentation

*List endpoints*, e.g.:

- `POST /api/users/signup` - User registration
- `POST /api/projects` - Create project
- `POST /api/projects/{id}/tasks` - Add task to project
- `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}` - Update task status

---

## User Guide

- **Running Locally:**  
  1. Clone repo and open in IDE.  
  2. Update `application.properties` with DB credentials.  
  3. Run `mvn spring-boot:run` or equivalent.  
  4. Use Postman or frontend to interact.

- **Usage:**  
  - Register and log in.  
  - Create projects and invite members.  
  - Add tasks and assign members.  
  - Track progress through task status updates.

---

## Deployment Guide

- Environment setup (Linux VM, Docker, or Cloud provider).
- Database setup (MySQL instance startup, schema initialization).
- Environment variables to configure (`DB_URL`, `DB_USERNAME`, etc.).
- Build the application (`mvn clean package`).
- Running `.jar` file or Docker container.
- Monitoring and logging instructions.

---

## Testing

- Unit tests with JUnit.
- Integration tests for API endpoints.
- Run tests using `mvn test`.

---

## Future Work & Known Issues

- Feature enhancements (e.g., comments on tasks, attachments).
- Performance improvements.
- Known bugs or missing validations.
